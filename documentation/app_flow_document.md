# vcr-online App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user arrives at the vcr-online website, they are greeted by a clean landing page that highlights the core features: virtual VCR emulation, remote device control, content management, and live streaming. A prominent sign-up button invites users to create an account with either their email or a linked Google account. Selecting email registration opens a form requesting name, email address, and password, followed by an email verification step. If the user chooses Google login, they are redirected to Google’s consent screen and then returned to vcr-online with an active session. After account creation, users are guided to set their display name and time zone. The sign-in page mirrors this process, offering both email/password and Google sign-in methods. If a user forgets their password, they can click a link on the sign-in form to enter their email address and receive a reset link. Once the link is clicked, they are directed to a secure page to enter a new password. All sessions include a logout option in the main navigation header, which immediately returns the user to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon logging in, users land on the Dashboard, which serves as the central hub. The top header displays the vcr-online logo on the left and the user’s avatar with a dropdown for settings and logout on the right. Below the header, a horizontal navigation bar shows quick links to Dashboard, Library, Emulation, Remote Control, Streaming, API & Integrations, and Help. The main content area presents widgets that summarize connected devices, recent uploads, active streaming sessions, and system notifications such as completed transcodes or device alerts. At the left edge of the screen, a collapsible sidebar provides the same links with icons and text. From any section of the Dashboard, clicking a navigation item transitions the user to the corresponding page without reloading the entire site, preserving context and state.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### VCR Emulation Flow

When the user selects Emulation, the virtual VCR interface loads at the center of the screen, complete with realistic buttons for play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, and record. Above the controls, a dropdown menu lists available tapes drawn from the user’s library. Choosing a tape triggers an animated tape insertion, and the timeline indicator appears. Pressing play begins playback of a digitized video segment in a canvas player. Rewind and fast-forward alter the playback position, and record captures any live feed back into a new virtual tape. Exiting the emulation mode returns the user seamlessly to their previous page in the Dashboard.

### Remote Control Integration Flow

Navigating to Remote Control displays a list of paired VCR devices with their online status. Tapping a device entry expands a familiar control panel identical to the emulation interface. Commands sent through these buttons are translated into network messages or USB signals to the physical hardware. To add a new device, the user clicks the "Add Device" button at the top, which reveals a pairing dialog. The dialog asks for a device code displayed on the VCR’s built-in screen or provides a scannable QR code. Once the code is entered, the system confirms the pairing, lists the new device among the others, and the user can immediately send commands. A back button returns the user to the main Dashboard.

### Content Management and Digitization Flow

Accessing the Library reveals a grid of video thumbnails with titles and status indicators. A search field at the top filters by keywords, and an "Upload" button opens a full-screen import form. Users drag and drop video files or select them from their local machine. The form offers fields for title, recording date, description, tags, and category. After submission, the upload progress bar shows real-time file transfer percentages. Once the file lands on the server, a transcoding progress indicator replaces the upload bar. Upon successful conversion to web-friendly formats, the new video appears in the library grid. Clicking a thumbnail opens a detail view where the user can play the video, edit metadata, review version history, or share a link. A back arrow in the top corner returns the user to the Library grid.

### Archival Database and Advanced Search Flow

Within the Library detail view, an expandable section labeled "History and Logs" lists every action taken on that tape, including uploads, edits, and transcodes. To perform more complex queries, the user clicks "Advanced Search" at the top of the Library page, which slides in a filter panel. This panel lets the user specify date ranges, device origins, and metadata fields. Applying filters updates the library results instantly, and a clear button removes all filters. Closing the filter panel returns the user’s focus to the updated library grid.

### Real-Time Video Streaming Flow

The Streaming section offers two tabs: Live and On-Demand. In Live mode, the user selects a paired VCR and clicks "Start Live Stream." The page shows a video player window with a real-time feed, along with controls to pause or mute. An indicator displays current bit rate and latency. When the live session ends, the user clicks "Stop Stream," and a prompt allows saving the session as a new library item. In On-Demand mode, selecting a video from the user’s library opens an adaptive streaming player. Controls for quality selection, captions, and playback speed appear below the video. Exiting the stream brings the user back to the Streaming page.

### API & Integrations Flow

Developers can visit the API & Integrations page from the main navigation. Here they see a list of existing API keys and a button to generate a new key. Clicking it reveals a modal that prompts for a key name and permissions scope. After creation, the new key displays in a table along with its creation date and status. Each row includes a revoke button. Below the keys, interactive API documentation shows endpoint definitions, request formats, and response examples. A built-in console allows test calls using the user’s active key. Navigating away from this page retains any generated keys automatically.

### Admin Panel Flow

Users with administrator roles see an additional "Admin" link in the sidebar. Clicking it leads to a user management screen listing all registered accounts. From here, an admin can search for a user, view their profile details, reset passwords, or change role assignments. Another tab under Admin shows system logs, presenting recent errors and usage metrics. Selecting a log entry opens a detailed view with stack traces or request payloads. Exiting the Admin panel returns the user to their previous location in the main app.

## Settings and Account Management

Clicking the user avatar in the header brings up a menu with a link to Settings. The Settings section is organized into tabs for Profile, Notifications, Subscription & Billing, and Security. In the Profile tab, users can update their display name, email address, and time zone. The Notifications tab lists toggle switches for email alerts on completed uploads or device disconnections. Subscription & Billing shows the current plan, upcoming renewal date, and a payment method form where new credit cards can be added or removed. The Security tab lets users change their password or enable two-factor authentication. Each tab has a save button that, when clicked, shows a confirmation banner at the top. A breadcrumb trail at the top of the Settings area lets users navigate back to the Dashboard or other core sections.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user enters incorrect credentials on the sign-in form, a red error message appears above the input fields, and the password field clears. The "Forgot Password" link remains available for recovery. During uploads, unsupported file formats trigger an inline error explaining the accepted types, and the file input resets. If network connectivity is lost at any point, a persistent banner appears across the top of the page stating "You are offline" and prompts the user to retry once connectivity returns. In the device control panel, if a VCR goes offline, command buttons become disabled and show a tooltip explaining the device is unreachable. Transcoding failures display an error icon next to the video item in the library with a "Retry Transcode" button. Users who attempt to visit restricted pages without proper roles are redirected to the Dashboard with a message indicating insufficient permissions.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

A typical user flow begins at the landing page, proceeds through account creation and email verification, and leads to the Dashboard. From there, the user may explore virtual VCR emulation, pair real devices through the Remote Control section, or manage and digitize tapes in the Library. Advanced search and archival history help the user keep track of media, while live and on-demand streaming enable immediate playback. Developers can extend functionality via API keys, and administrators maintain system integrity through the Admin panel. Throughout the experience, users adjust preferences in Settings and handle any errors via clear messages and recovery options. Ultimately, vcr-online guides users from first sign-on to routine operations like playing, uploading, and streaming video content in a cohesive and intuitive journey.
