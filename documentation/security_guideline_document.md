# Security Guidelines for vcr-online

This document establishes the security principles, controls, and best practices to guide the design, development, and operation of the **vcr-online** application. It covers core security domains—authentication, data protection, API security, infrastructure hardening, and more—to ensure a defense-in-depth posture and protect both user data and connected hardware.

---

## 1. Threat Model & High-Level Risks

- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers gain control of user accounts or administrative interfaces, potentially operating physical VCRs remotely.  
- **Command Injection & Remote Exploits**: Malicious inputs injected via API endpoints or device pairing interfaces could lead to arbitrary code execution.  
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Leakage of user PII, archive metadata, or streaming content in transit or at rest.  
- **Stream Tampering & Replay**: Unauthorized interception, modification, or replay of live video streams.  
- **Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities**: Compromised third-party libraries, firmware, or hardware drivers.

---

## 2. Core Security Principles

- **Security by Design**: Integrate security in every feature—from VCR-emulation logic to remote-control APIs.  
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum rights to services, database users, and hardware interfaces.  
- **Defense in Depth**: Layer authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, and monitoring.  
- **Fail Securely**: Default to a safe state on errors (e.g., deny commands if validation fails).  
- **Keep Security Simple**: Prefer straightforward, auditable mechanisms over complex custom solutions.  
- **Secure Defaults**: Disable debugging, enforce secure cookies, enable TLS by default.

## 3. Authentication & Access Control

- **Strong User Authentication**  
  • Enforce minimum password length (≥ 10 characters) and complexity  
  • Hash passwords with Argon2 or bcrypt using unique salts  
  • Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative and device-pairing accounts

- **Session Management**  
  • Generate cryptographically random session tokens  
  • Enforce idle (e.g., 15 min) and absolute (e.g., 8 hr) timeouts  
  • Invalidate sessions on password change or device unpairing  
  • Protect against session fixation by regenerating IDs on login

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Define roles (User, Archivist, Administrator) and least privileges per role  
  • Perform server-side authorization checks for every API call (e.g., command or metadata update)  
  • Log authorization failures for audit

---

## 4. Input Handling & Output Encoding

- **API Input Validation**  
  • Validate JSON payloads against a strict schema (e.g., OpenAPI)  
  • Reject unexpected or extraneous fields  
  • Sanitize metadata fields (titles, tags) to strip HTML/JS

- **Command & Device-Pairing Interfaces**  
  • Whitelist allowed commands and parameter ranges (e.g., play, rewind)  
  • Rate-limit device-pairing attempts to mitigate brute force  
  • Use challenge–response or one-time codes for pairing physical hardware

- **File Uploads (Digitized Footage)**  
  • Restrict file types to approved codecs/containers (MP4, WebM)  
  • Enforce maximum file size per upload and total user quota  
  • Scan uploads for malware using antivirus/AV scanning services  
  • Store uploads outside the webroot with randomized filenames  
  • Validate file contents match declared MIME types

- **Output Encoding & XSS Protection**  
  • Context-aware escaping in HTML templates (e.g., React’s default escaping)  
  • Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict scripts/styles  
  • Use security HTTP headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`)

---

## 5. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encryption in Transit & At Rest**  
  • Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) with HSTS (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`)  
  • Encrypt sensitive database columns (e.g., PII) using AES-256  
  • Secure backups with encryption and limited-access storage

- **Secrets Management**  
  • Store API keys, DB credentials, and certificates in a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)  
  • Rotate secrets periodically and on suspicion of compromise

- **PII Handling & Compliance**  
  • Collect only necessary user data (data minimization)  
  • Implement data retention and deletion policies to meet GDPR/CCPA  
  • Mask or redact PII in logs and error messages

---

## 6. API & Service Security

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  • Apply per-IP and per-user rate limits on authentication and device-control endpoints  
  • Return generic error messages on rate-limit breaches

- **CORS & CSRF Protection**  
  • Restrict CORS to approved origins (e.g., your frontend domain)  
  • Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations (synchronizer token pattern)

- **API Versioning & Deprecation**  
  • Version endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/`)  
  • Maintain backward compatibility where feasible  
  • Document deprecation timelines

- **Least-Privileged Service Accounts**  
  • Create separate DB users for read vs. write  
  • Limit network access using micro-segmentation

---

## 7. Web Application Security Hygiene

- **Security Headers**  
  • `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`  
  • `Permissions-Policy` to disable unused features (e.g., geolocation)  
  • Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all CDN-loaded assets

- **Secure Cookies**  
  • `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` on session cookies  
  • Avoid storing tokens or PII in localStorage/sessionStorage

- **XSS & Clickjacking**  
  • Validate and sanitize any rich text input  
  • Use `frame-ancestors 'none'` in CSP to prevent framing

---

## 8. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

- **Server Hardening**  
  • Apply latest OS and package security updates  
  • Disable unused services and close non-essential ports  
  • Enforce strong SSH key authentication and disable root login

- **TLS Configuration**  
  • Disable SSLv3/TLS 1.0/1.1  
  • Prefer ephemeral key exchange (ECDHE) and strong ciphers (AES-GCM)

- **Container & Deployment Security**  
  • Run containers as non-root users  
  • Lock down filesystem permissions inside containers  
  • Use image-scanning tools (e.g., Clair, Anchore) during CI/CD pipelines

---

## 9. Dependency Management

- **Use Trusted Libraries**  
  • Vet third-party SDKs for hardware integration  
  • Avoid unmaintained packages and large dependency trees

- **Vulnerability Scanning**  
  • Integrate SCA tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to detect CVEs  
  • Review and approve dependency upgrades before merging

- **Lockfiles & Deterministic Builds**  
  • Commit `package-lock.json`/`Pipfile.lock` to source control  
  • Periodically rebuild dependencies in an isolated environment

---

## 10. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response

- **Secure Logging**  
  • Log authentication success/failures, device-pairing events, critical system errors  
  • Sanitize logs to exclude PII and sensitive tokens  
  • Centralize logs in a tamper-evident system (e.g., ELK, Splunk)

- **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts**  
  • Configure alerts for abnormal rates of login failures, rate-limit breaches, or device commands  
  • Monitor resource usage to detect DDoS or misconfiguration incidents

- **Incident Response Plan**  
  • Define roles and processes for triage, containment, eradication, and recovery  
  • Maintain runbooks for common scenarios (e.g., compromised secret, unresponsive hardware link)

---

## 11. Developer & Operational Best Practices

- **Code Reviews & Pair Programming**  
  • Enforce peer reviews on all code changes, especially security-relevant logic  
  • Use automated static analysis (linting, security scanners)

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
  • Enforce security gates (e.g., SAST, SCA) before merges  
  • Deploy to staging with production-like configs for testing

- **Documentation & Training**  
  • Keep security guidelines and architecture diagrams up to date  
  • Provide regular security awareness training for developers and ops
