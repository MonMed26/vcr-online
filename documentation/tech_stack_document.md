# Tech Stack Document: vcr-online

This document explains the technologies chosen for the vcr-online project in simple, everyday language. It covers the frontend, backend, infrastructure, integrations, security, and performance decisions, along with a summary of how everything fits together.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

These are the tools and libraries that run in the user’s browser, creating the visible interface and interactive experience:

- React
  - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Helps create the virtual VCR controls (play, pause, rewind, etc.) in an organized, component-based way.
- Tailwind CSS
  - A styling tool that provides ready-to-use CSS classes.
  - Speeds up design and ensures a consistent look and feel for buttons, sliders, and panels.
- WebRTC
  - A browser feature for real-time video streaming.
  - Used to play live or near-live video feeds directly in the browser with minimal delay.
- Axios
  - A simple library for making HTTP requests.
  - Lets the interface talk to the backend to fetch tape metadata, send remote-control commands, and manage user profiles.
- React Router
  - Manages navigation within the app.
  - Enables smooth transitions between pages like the dashboard, tape library, and device management.

These choices work together to deliver a fast, responsive, and engaging user experience, so interacting with a virtual or physical VCR feels natural and intuitive.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The backend powers the core logic, data storage, and communication with hardware. Here’s what we use:

- Node.js + Express
  - A JavaScript runtime and web framework for building the server.
  - Handles incoming requests for playing tapes, managing archives, and controlling physical devices.
- PostgreSQL
  - A reliable relational database for storing structured data.
  - Keeps records of tape details, user accounts, device pairings, and historical logs.
- Redis
  - An in-memory data store used for caching and real-time status updates.
  - Ensures quick lookups for live device monitoring and session management.
- FFmpeg
  - An open-source media tool for converting and processing video.
  - Transcodes analog captures into web-friendly formats (MP4, WebM) and segments streams for HLS delivery.
- WebSocket (Socket.io)
  - A library for two-way, real-time communication between browser and server.
  - Drives live status updates and remote-control commands for paired VCRs.
- OpenAPI (Swagger)
  - A specification that documents the RESTful API.
  - Makes it easy for external developers to understand and integrate with vcr-online’s core services.

Together, these components ensure that data flows smoothly between the user’s browser, the database, and any connected VCR hardware.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

This section covers where and how the application lives in the cloud, and how we automate its delivery:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - EC2 instances run the backend services.
  - S3 stores archived video files and user uploads.
  - CloudFront distributes static assets (JavaScript, CSS, video segments) via a global content delivery network.
- Docker
  - Containers package each service (backend, frontend, database) with its environment.
  - Ensures consistent behavior across development, testing, and production.
- GitHub + GitHub Actions
  - GitHub tracks all source code with version control.
  - GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deploying containers whenever changes are pushed.
- Terraform (optional)
  - Infrastructure-as-code tool to define and manage AWS resources in a transparent, repeatable way.

By using these choices, we can reliably release updates, scale services up or down, and recover quickly if something goes wrong.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

vcr-online connects to several external services to enrich its feature set:

- Stripe
  - Processes payments for premium features or higher usage plans.
  - Securely handles credit card transactions without storing sensitive data on our servers.
- Google Analytics
  - Tracks user behavior and usage patterns.
  - Helps the team improve the interface and prioritize new features based on real-world metrics.
- Twilio (optional)
  - Sends SMS notifications for device pairing codes or security alerts.
  - Provides an extra layer of user communication and verification.

These integrations add value without reinventing the wheel, letting us focus on the core VCR experience.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Security Measures:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Authenticates users in a stateless, secure way.
  - Tokens carry user identity and roles for easy permission checks.
- HTTPS / TLS
  - Encrypts all data traveling between users and the servers.
  - Ensures privacy and protection against eavesdropping.
- Role-Based Access Control
  - Separates regular users from administrators and device operators.
  - Prevents unauthorized access to critical functions.
- Input Validation and Sanitization
  - Checks and cleans all incoming data to guard against injection attacks.

Performance Optimizations:

- Caching with Redis
  - Reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- CDN (CloudFront)
  - Serves static files from edge locations close to users.
- Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
  - Loads only the necessary frontend code for each page.
  - Reduces initial page load times and improves perceived speed.
- Auto-Scaling (AWS)
  - Adjusts compute resources dynamically based on traffic.
  - Maintains a smooth experience even during peak usage.

These measures ensure that user data is safe, and the application remains fast and responsive.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In building vcr-online, we chose modern, widely adopted technologies that:

- Deliver a familiar, high-performance interface with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Power complex workflows and real-time features using Node.js, Express, WebSocket, and Redis.
- Store and manage data reliably in PostgreSQL and S3, with FFmpeg handling media transcoding.
- Leverage AWS, Docker, and GitHub Actions for scalable, repeatable deployments.
- Extend functionality through Stripe, Google Analytics, and Twilio integrations.
- Protect users with JWT, HTTPS, and role-based controls while optimizing speed via caching and CDNs.

This combination of tools and services aligns perfectly with the project’s goals: to emulate, stream, manage, and archive VCR content—online, securely, and at scale.

By using this tech stack, vcr-online stands out as a reliable, user-friendly platform that bridges the analog past with the digital present.
